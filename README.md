## 📁 Repository Structure

- **`python_codes/`**  
  Contains Jupyter notebooks implementing core image processing techniques:
  - `basic_image_handling.ipynb` – Loading, displaying, and manipulating basic images
  - `Filters.ipynb` – Applying smoothing and sharpening filters
  - `Image_segmentation.ipynb` – Techniques like thresholding and region-based segmentation
  - `Noise_models.ipynb` – Simulating and handling noise in images
  - `Scaling.ipynb` – Resizing and interpolation methods
  - `histogram.ipynb` – Histogram equalization and analysis

- **`Images/`**  
  - Includes general image samples and a real **DICOM file of a brain MRI scan** for practical medical image processing applications.
